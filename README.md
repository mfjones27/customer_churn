# Churn Prediction Project  

This project predicts customer churn using a machine learning pipeline. It processes customer data, selects relevant features, and applies a Random Forest Classifier to classify customers as churned or retained.

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical data and identifies outliers.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Drops irrelevant columns and selects significant features.  
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest model with feature importance analysis.  
- **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance and accuracy.
